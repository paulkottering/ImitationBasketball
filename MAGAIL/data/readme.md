This folder is supposed to be blank. The notebook converts the 7z files in the 'datasets' folder to store the extracted json files here.
The json files are huge (~100 MB), hence it is not directly uploaded to github since it only allows upto 25 MB (and easier to download and convert 7z files instead)
